Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) dropped 16% and Oil India declined 10.7% on Monday as lower crude prices will erode earnings. Reliance Industries plunged 12% on Monday over concern that lower oil prices could affect a proposed deal with Saudi Aramco that\\u2019s critical for reducing the Indian oil-to-telecom conglomerate\\u2019s debt. Shares of oil refiners-andmarketers Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) jumped as falling crude prices mean lower procurement costs.BPCL closed 4.2% higher while HPCL gained 4.4%. Indian Oil Corp. (IOC) ended 2.2% up, having risen 3% in trade.\\\"Oil marketing companies could do well in the medium term since the price of oil is expected to remain at the lower end for some time,\\\" said G Chokkalingam, founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory. \\\"Also, soft oil prices could postpone the transition to electrical vehicles by another couple of years.\\\"Crude prices declined 21% on Monday following the Saudi move to start a price war after Russia balked at making further steep output cuts proposed by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to stabilise oil markets hit by worries over the global spread of the coronavirus.The Reliance decline on Monday was its worst one-day loss in 12 years. Analysts said the oil price crash could pose a hurdle to an early commencement of Reliance\\u2019s proposed deal with Aramco, whose shares fell below its IPO price on Monday for the first time ever. In the last two days, Aramco has lost $320 billion in market value. The December IPO price had valued it at $1.7 trillion. \\\"Saudi Aramco\\u2019s cash flow may be deeply constrained because of that,\\\" said Sandip Sabharwal, a Mumbai-based independent market analyst. \\\"At this stage what the markets are factoring in is that the deal may not happen and they will not be able to do the deleveraging as they had promised.\\\"Reliance didn\\u2019t respond to queries.With Monday\\u2019s fall, the stock has fallen more than 31% from its record high. Its market value has slumped by more than Rs 3 lakh crore to Rs 7.06 lakh crore from a peak of Rs 10.14 lakh crore in December when the share hit a record of Rs 1,617.80. Tata Consultancy Services overtook it as the company with the highest market value at Rs 7.4 lakh crore. Reliance closed 12.35% lower on Monday at Rs 1,113.15 after falling nearly 14% during the session.Worries about the deal aren\\u2019t justified, some market participants said.\\\"Oil prices do not matter for Reliance Industries as it is not a producer but some in the market have a concern that Saudi Aramco deal may not happen because of the fall in crude oil prices,\\\" said Sanjeev Prasad, co-head, Kotak Institutional Equities. \\\"I do not think that Saudi Aramco is weighing a deal, which is for the long term, on the basis of one day\\u2019s market fall. I don't think these concerns are material.\\\" Kotak has a buy rating on Reliance Industries.Goldman Sachs cut the target price on the stock by 5% to Rs 1,750, saying that the macro environment for the hydrocarbon business is challenging due to the negative shock to oil demand from the coronavirus outbreak, partly offset by lower crude premiums for Asian refiners. However, it has retained a buy rating for Reliance as it believes the correction is overdone.Morgan Stanley has also cut the target price on the stock \\u2014 to Rs 1,632 from Rs 1,753 \\u2014 but maintained an overweight rating. The brokerage has moved the stock up in its preference order to a top pick.\\\"Reliance is down to levels reached last year when it stated its plan to lower debt; concern about energy cashflow is rising. The stock is pricing in cash cost industry margins on energy, and limited upside from de-gearing despite reduced capital intensity, higher ARPUs (average revenue per user), and improved ROCE (return on capital employed),\\\" said Morgan Stanley.\",\n          \"Mumbai: Shares of Reliance Industries could advance by as much as 4 per cent on Monday as the oil-to-telecom conglomerate\\u2019s 26 per cent growth in third quarter net profit from a year earlier has beat analysts\\u2019 estimates. But, any weakness in the market could put a lid on gains in the stock price, said analysts.\\u201cReliance is likely to move up 3-4 per cent and can set the Nifty back towards 12,600,\\u201d said Sanjiv Bhasin, director, IIFL Securities. \\u201cReliance has clearly surprised on the Jio front. There was pessimism about Jio and that has now been cleared. Before Budget Reliance can see at least a 5 per cent upside,\\u201d said Bhasin.Net profit rose to Rs 14,894 crore for the three months ended December from Rs 11,841 crore in the same period a year ago. Shares of RIL ended down 2.3 per cent at Rs 2,049.65 on Friday but it had gained over 8 per cent in the preceding four sessions in anticipation of a strong quarterly result.\\u201cOverall the results are positive except for the retail vertical. All other verticals have performed well. This is not a major surprise however,\\u201d said Independent market expert Ambareesh Baliga. \\u201cLooking at the weakness in the market, I don\\u2019t think it can shoot up from here. It may see a 1-2 per cent upside. In the run-up to the earnings, it has moved up.\\u201dFollowing the result, Prabhudas Lilladher has maintained buy rating on RIL with a target price of Rs 2,232. BOB Capital Markets maintained reduce rating saying that outlook for oil-to-chemicals remains cloudy. Macquarie has maintained underperform with a target price of Rs 1,350. \\u201cWith RIL\\u2019s shares today trading near our fundamental blue-sky valuation, we continue to flag a significant negative risk-reward skew in the face of potential execution challenges,\\u201d said Macquarie.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
